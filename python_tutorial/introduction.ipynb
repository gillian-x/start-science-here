    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's interpreted because python programs don't need to be compiled.\n",
    "- It's a high-level programming language, because of its layer of abstraction. You don't need to write instructions which memory register to pass through which core of the CPU. This would also prohibit us from sharing code, between different processors.\n",
    "- It's general purpose, because you can do almost anything with it. From math, websites, inventory management systems to computational chemistry.\n",

    "*jupyter-notebooks* contain a number of so-called cells. Cells can either be code cells, or markdown cells. This text is written in a markdown cell. In these cells text is easier to read and can be formatted *like* **these** ~~examples~~ here. You can make lists, tables and format your text nicely. These markdown cells accompany the code cells. In the code cells the magic happens. These cells contain code segments which can be executed on a cell-by-cell basis. All variables declared in the code cells are available as long as the notebook is running. This means that contrary to a code.py file a variable declared in a cell further down can be used in a cell further up, as long as the cell with the variable declaration is ran first.\n",
