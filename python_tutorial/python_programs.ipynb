    "## A python program\n",

    "Writing code that way is not very convenient. You have to retype quite a lot and making changes to something would have you re-typing quite a lot. That's why we put python code into files (normally with the `.py` file extension). If you tell python to run on a file it will execute the code in that file line-after-line. These files are basically complete python programs. Try creating a simple text file called `my_awesome_program.py` and put this line of code into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('You are awesome!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For linux/WSL/mybinder users**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either `nano` to create the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ nano my_awesome_program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the code and save it by hitting (`Ctrl` and `X` to save and `y` to confirm). You can also put the contents into the file using `echo`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ echo \"print('You are awesome!')\" > my_awesome_program.py\n",
    "$ # check contents with \n",
    "$ cat my_awesome_program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**For windows users**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new text file with the text editor of you choice. For this basic program the windos notepad (aka editor) will suffice. Make sure the file extension is `.py` and rename the file if not. You can now double-click the file, which will run it with python. **However,** after it has finished running the window will close automatically and you probably won't be able to read the output of the program. We need a windows shell to run the program. Open the Windows command prompt by hitting the `Windows Key` + `X` and navigate to the location of the file. If you saved the file to a different drive, than the standard `C:\\` drive, you can change to that drive by calling simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "> D:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can navigate to the file. Use backslashes `\\` and not slashes as path separators and use `cd ..` to go back one directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the program**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your program on either of the command lines/shells by calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python my_awesome_program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on bash and\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "> python my_awesome_program.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on Windows Command prompt. This usage of python is still not very useful when developing code. That's why we are using *jupyter-notebooks*."
