**An introduction to scientific programming, python, molecular dynamics and more**

Welcome to start science here! This project is meant to introduce you to the world of scientific programming and teach you the most important concepts. This project is subdivided into different main topics. You can dive right into the python tutorial by visiting: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kevinsawade/start-science-here/HEAD. If you want to take the full course, take the recommended route:

1. Working with Linux from the command line
2. Installing the Windows subsystem for Linux (Windows users only)
3. Installing Docker
4. Gromacs
5. Python
6. Setting up your own python
7. Git
8. Your first project

There is no set up required to follow along with this tutorial. It can take three to four days to work through everything (the python tutorial is very long, but can be put on hold after the beginner tutorials).

.. prereq::

   * A working internet connection
   * An up-to-date browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge)

Linux Tutorial
==============

The recommended route starts with the linux tutorial: :ref:`linux-tutorial-label`.
