Propose Changes
===============

Proposing changes is also a very nice way of improving start science here. On this page you will learn how to propose your own changes to start science here. Let's say you found a very nasty typo and want to help the developers resolving that. If that typo was on a page in the documentation you can use the "Edit on GitHub" button to directly jump to the source file of that page.

The .rst file is again rendered nicely, but we want to edit it and fix the punctuation in one sentence. Open the editing window via clicking on the pen button.

Let's make some changes and use the "Propose Changes" button at the very bottom, combined with some descriptive text, to propose these changes to the developers.

From here, we want to create a pull request. That way the developers can simply accept your proposed changes with a single button click.

The pull request is designed similar to an issue. Just put some descriptive text here.

The developers will then approve your pull request like so:

Thank you!

If you made some changes via a pull request and improved start science here, I want to thank you. Thanks for your work and effort and thanks for helping me out.
